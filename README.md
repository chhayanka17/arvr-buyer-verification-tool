# AR/VR Buyer Verification Tool for E-Commerce

## Overview
This project is a **buyer-oriented AR/VR verification tool** designed to help users verify the authenticity of electronic devices before purchasing from any seller.

⚠️ This is NOT a shopping platform.  
It is a **support tool** to save buyer time, money, and prevent fraud.
